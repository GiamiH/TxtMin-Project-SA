## Romeo vs. Juliet: Investigating Gender-Based Linguistic Variations in Online Reviews: A Sentiment Analysis Approach

### Abstract 

### Research Questions 
- MQ: Which gender is likely to give a positive, neutral, or negative review?
- Which gender is more likely to be critical in their review? 
  - Check how many words and how often the words are repeated.
- Which gender has the longest review?

### Datasets 
- iPhone Reviews from Amazon (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/apple-iphone-11-reviews-from-amazon-com) - Reviews of iPhone XR contains around 5010 reviews of the product. The data contains many extra fields which we are not interested in such as the total_comments, url, reviewed_at (date) and others. The idea would be to check where there are any types of emojis or punctuation that would help in the sentimental analysis part of it.

### Questions of Each Update
Update 0:
- We want to use a gender guesser library to guess the gender of the reviewer since most datasets do not provide that info. However, we are unsure of how it would approach names that could be used for males and females (ex. Jamie). What would you advise?

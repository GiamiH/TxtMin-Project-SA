## Romeo vs. Juliet: Investigating Gender-Based Linguistic Variations in Online Reviews: A Sentiment Analysis Approach

### Abstract 
This project aims to investigate how language and sentiment vary between online reviews written by men and women. Understanding the role of gender in review language is essential for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively and efficiently. We plan to use a dataset of online reviews sourced from various platforms, and look at how differently language is used between genders. By using processing techniques, we will extract sentiments and linguistic features to examine differences between male and female-authored reviews. We also plan to use libraries that are available for gender identification to determine the gender of the user(name). Analyzing patterns will help reveal insights into gender-specific linguistic tendencies, and give deeper insights into underlying preferences driving review composition. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of gender dynamics in online discourse and offer actionable implications for businesses looking to engage with diverse consumer segments. 

### Research Questions 
- MQ: Which gender is likely to give a positive, neutral, or negative review?

### Questions of Each Update
Update 0:
- We want to use a gender guesser library to guess the gender of the reviewer since most datasets do not provide that info. However, we are unsure of how it would approach names that could be used for males and females (ex. Jamie). What would you advise?

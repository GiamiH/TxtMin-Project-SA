Only complaint that face reader is not as great as fingerprint reader in older version of iphone.,neutral
The battery is not a 4000 mah  like many other phones these but still has a lot of life in it . This is my second IPHONE and the performance just outclasses any android phone,positive

Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You won‚Äôt find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched.,positive
Awsm,positive

After using it for 6 days properly . The phone started to hang it automatically restarts and gets stuck on apple log had to format my phone 2 time. Apple service center could not detect the problem . THEY Said it should be sent to bangalore for repair due to some motherboard issue . So i dnt want all that headache i want my phone replaced by a new sealed pack same iphone,negative

"need i say anything about this phone! it's a bomb. i bought the product red 64GB varient and let me tell you its sexier than it appears in the pictures. camera quality is really good. the portraits are awesome even though it has a single lens. the bezzel looks a bit wide compared to XS and XS Max, but if you are upgrading from Iphone 8 Plus or lower you won't find it different. The liquid display is really nice with wide range of colors displayed really well. i got this during the independence day sale for Rs.52K and its definitely a great deal. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!",positive
"Serious problem with the lower mic, after spending all that money in this faulty crap just after two months you finally feel that you are the biggest C* in India who is buying an iPhone. Fragile product, connectivity issue, software issue & restrictions  all the type of minor issues have been build up causing a serious issue. Think before you waste ya hard earned money. Apple products are degrading their quality to keep their stocks and shares up.",negative
